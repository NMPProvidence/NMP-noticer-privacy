<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
  Noticer does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit</strong> any personal data from users.
  All notes created in the app are stored <strong>locally on the user's device</strong> in a secure SQLite database.
  The app does not use any cloud synchronization, account registration, or data tracking.
</p>
<p>
  If users enter personal information into their notes (e.g., names, emails, health or contact data),
  it remains on the device and is <strong>entirely under the user's control and responsibility</strong>.
</p>

<h2>2. Backups</h2>
<p>
  Users can manually export backups of their notes to the device’s <code>Documents</code> folder.
  Backups are saved as <strong>password-protected ZIP files</strong> containing the local database.
  The developer has no access to these files or any user data.
</p>

<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
<p>
  Noticer displays <strong>non-personalized ads</strong> using Google AdMob. These ads are based on general, contextual information (such as the app category or language settings), not user data.

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device type and language</li>
  <li>App usage (e.g., number of opens)</li>
  <li>Approximate location (e.g., country)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Noticer does not allow personalized advertising or user profiling. This helps ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>.
